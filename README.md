4. Search Functionality: Efficient search capabilities with filters (e.g., category,
price, location).
5. Ad Posting Interface: A user-friendly interface for posting new ads with text,

6. Communication Platform: A secure system for users to communicate with each
other within the website.
7. Admin Dashboard: For site administrators to manage ads, users, and site

deployment.
2. User Manual: A guide on how to use the website, aimed at end-users.
3. Video Demo: A video demonstrating the website's features and functionalities.
Video duration: 10 minutes maximum
